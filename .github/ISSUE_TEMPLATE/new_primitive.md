## 🎯 Agent Primitive Proposal

### Primitive Details

**Name**: (e.g., `al-integration-testing`)
**Type**: 
- [ ] Instruction (`.instructions.md`)
- [ ] Agentic Workflow (`.prompt.md`)
- [ ] Agent (`.agent.md`)

**Category**: (e.g., Testing, Performance, Integration, Architecture)

## 📋 Description

Provide a clear, concise description of what this primitive does and why it's needed.

## 🎨 Frontmatter

```yaml
---
description: 'Your one-line description (max 100 chars)'
applyTo: ['**/*.al']  # Or specific pattern for instructions
# For chat modes, include:
# tools: [files, workspace_search, etc.]
# mcp: { allowed: [...], forbidden: [...] }
---
```
