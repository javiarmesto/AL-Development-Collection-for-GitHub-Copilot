## Security Best Practices

When using this collection:

1. **Review Instructions**: Always review auto-applied instructions before accepting generated code
2. **Validate Prompts**: Verify that prompts match your security requirements
3. **Sensitive Data**: Never include credentials, tokens, or sensitive data in instruction files
4. **Access Control**: Use GitHub's access controls for private repositories
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated (run `npm audit` regularly)

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- All instruction files (`.instructions.md`)
- All agentic workflows (`.prompt.md`)
- All chat modes (`.chatmode.md`)
