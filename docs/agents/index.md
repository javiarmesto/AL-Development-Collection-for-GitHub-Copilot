# Agents - Layer 2: Agent Primitives

**Role-based strategic consultants** implemented as `.agent.md` files with **MCP Tool Boundaries** for specialized AL development guidance in Business Central.

## 📋 What Are Agents?

Agents are:
- **Specialized consultant personas** with domain expertise
- **Strategic advisors** (not executors - they recommend workflows)
- **Context-aware specialists** that auto-load relevant Instructions
- **Boundary-constrained agents** with clear CAN/CANNOT rules (MCP model)

## 🎯 How to Use Agents

Activate modes explicitly for strategic consultation:
```markdown
Use [mode-name]

Examples:
Use al-architect
Use al-conductor
Use al-debugger
```

Or in multi-turn conversations:
```markdown
---
mode: al-architect
title: Complex feature planning
---

I need to build a sales forecasting system...
```

## 📊 Complexity-Based Agent Selection

> ⚠️ **Experimental & Customizable Framework**: The complexity classification system is an **experimental heuristic** that provides initial guidance. **You can modify these criteria** by editing the framework files in your repository (`agents/index.md`, `instructions/copilot-instructions.md`) to match your team's expertise, organizational standards, and project requirements. Adapt thresholds, add custom criteria, or redefine complexity levels based on your context.

**All agents use automatic complexity inference with mandatory validation gate** - the system analyzes your requirements and suggests the appropriate complexity level, then you confirm before proceeding.

### Complexity Classification Matrix

| Complexity | Scope | Phases | TDD | Recommended Agent | Estimated Time |
|-------------|-------|-------|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| 🟢 **LOW** | Limited scope - isolated change | 1 phase | Optional | **al-developer** | 15-30 min |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Moderate scope - internal integrations | 2-3 phases | Recommended | **al-conductor** | 1-3 hours |
| 🔴 **HIGH** | Extensive scope - complex architecture | 4+ phases | Mandatory | **al-architect** → **al-conductor** | 3+ hours |

**Note**: Scope refers to the breadth and depth of functionality, not the count of AL objects. Focus on integration complexity, business logic depth, and architectural impact.

**Customization Tip**: You can adjust these complexity definitions by editing this file in your repository. For example, if your team typically works with smaller changes, you might redefine MEDIUM as "1-2 phases" instead of "2-3 phases". The framework adapts to your workflow.

> 💡 **Note**: Subagents are automatically invoked by `al-conductor` via `runSubagent` tool. You don't invoke them directly.

### 🔧 Specialized Consultants (Complexity-Agnostic)

| Mode | Role | Works With | Best For |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| **al-debugger** | Systematic Debugging Specialist | Any complexity | Root cause analysis, performance bottlenecks, execution flow |
| **al-tester** | Testing Strategy & TDD Expert | Any complexity | Test design, TDD strategy, coverage planning |
| **al-api** | RESTful API Design Specialist | 🟡 MEDIUM / 🔴 HIGH | API contracts, endpoint design, external integrations |
| **al-copilot** | AI-Powered Features Expert | 🟡 MEDIUM / 🔴 HIGH | Copilot experiences, prompt engineering, Azure OpenAI integration |

## 🏗️ Tool Boundaries (MCP Model)

Each mode follows **professional licensing** constraints:

### CAN (Strategic/Advisory)
- ✅ Design solutions and patterns
- ✅ Analyze code and architecture
- ✅ Recommend approaches
- ✅ Plan implementations
- ✅ Review and critique
- ✅ Explain concepts

### CANNOT (Execution - Delegates to Workflows)
- ❌ Execute builds directly
- ❌ Run debuggers
- ❌ Deploy code
- ❌ Run tests
- ❌ Modify files without explicit request

**Why?** This prevents:
- Context window pollution from execution logs
- Cross-domain operations (architect shouldn't debug)
- Loss of strategic focus

## 🎯 Complexity-Based Decision Flow with Validation Gate

**MANDATORY PROCESS**: All agents analyze requirements → infer complexity → present classification → user confirms → route to appropriate workflow

## 🔄 Mode Combinations & Workflows

### Common Patterns

1. **New Feature Development**
   ```
   al-architect (design) → al-conductor (TDD) → al-debugger (if needed)
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**
   ```
   al-debugger (diagnosis) → Execute al-performance.triage → al-architect (redesign)
   ```

3. **Testing Implementation**
   ```
   al-tester (strategy) → Execute test creation → al-debugger (fix failures)
   ```

4. **API Development**
   ```
   al-architect (overall design) → al-api (endpoint design) → Execute al-build
   ```

### Mode Handoffs

Modes can recommend switching:
```markdown
Architect: "Design complete. Switch to al-conductor for TDD implementation."
Conductor: "Implementation complete. Execute @workspace /al-build to deploy."
Debugger: "Root cause identified. Switch to al-architect to redesign this component."
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- **Start with al-architect** for new features (design first)
- **Use al-conductor** for medium/high complexity TDD orchestration
- **Stay in strategic mode** - let modes recommend workflows
- **Provide context** (#file:, business requirements)
- **Ask about alternatives** and trade-offs
- **Request explanations** of recommendations

### ❌ DON'T

- Ask modes to execute builds/tests directly (they'll recommend workflows)
- Switch modes mid-conversation without reason
- Expect implementation without using recommended workflows
- Forget to include relevant code context

### Creating Custom Agents

1. **Create file** in this directory: `al-[role].agent.md`
2. **Add frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: 'Brief role description'
   tools: ['codebase', 'search', 'usages']
   ---
   ```
3. **Define the persona**:
   - Role & specialization
   - Markdown Prompt Engineering principles
   - Tool Boundaries (CAN/CANNOT)
   - Context Engineering strategy
   - Interaction protocol
4. **Update collection manifest** in `collections/al-development.collection.yml`
5. **Test** with sample scenarios
