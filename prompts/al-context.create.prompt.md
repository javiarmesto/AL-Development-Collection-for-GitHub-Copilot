# AL Context File Generator

Generate a comprehensive `context.md` file that serves as the **master context document** for AI assistants and developers working on this AL/Business Central project.

## Purpose

The `context.md` file provides:
- **Project Overview**: What this extension does and its business purpose
- **Architecture Snapshot**: How the code is organized and key patterns used
- **Critical Decisions**: Important architectural choices and their rationale
- **Integration Points**: Dependencies, events, APIs exposed/consumed
- **Quick Navigation**: Where to find specific functionality

This enables AI assistants to load complete project context quickly and make informed suggestions.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Analyze Project Structure

**Load project metadata:**
```powershell
# Get app.json configuration
@read_file app.json

# Understand dependencies
@al_get_package_dependencies

# Map directory structure
@list_dir src/
```

**Identify key patterns:**
```powershell
# Find all table extensions
@search "tableextension" *.al

# Find all page extensions
@search "pageextension" *.al

# Find event subscribers
@search "EventSubscriber" *.al

# Find published integration events
@search "IntegrationEvent" *.al

# Find API pages
@search "APIPublisher\|APIVersion" *.al
```

### 2. Analyze Business Domain

**Understand what the extension does:**
- Read README.md if exists
- Analyze table/page names to understand business entities
- Check codeunit names for business processes
- Review comments and XML docs for business rules

**Key questions to answer:**
- What business problem does this solve?
- Who are the end users?
- What standard BC functionality does it extend?
- What industry/vertical is this for (if applicable)?

### 3. Document Architecture Patterns

**Identify and document:**
- **Organization Strategy**: Feature-based vs object-type folders?
- **Naming Conventions**: Prefixes, suffixes, patterns used
- **Extension Patterns**: How are standard objects extended?
- **Event Usage**: Subscriber patterns, custom events published
- **Data Model**: Key tables and their relationships
- **Processing Logic**: Main codeunits and their responsibilities
- **UI Structure**: Page organization and user flows

### 4. Map Integration Points

**Document:**
- **Dependencies**: What other extensions are required?
- **Events Subscribed**: Which standard BC events are hooked?
- **Events Published**: What integration events does this extension provide?
- **APIs**: REST/OData endpoints exposed
- **External Integrations**: External systems connected (if any)
- **Web Services**: SOAP services published (if any)

### 5. Capture Critical Decisions

**Document key architectural choices:**
- Why certain tables are structured in specific ways
- Why specific event patterns were chosen
- Performance optimization decisions
- Security/permission design rationale
- Any constraints or limitations to be aware of

### 6. Generate context.md

Create the file at project root with this structure:

```markdown
# Project Context - [Extension Name]

---

**Maintenance**: Update this file when:
- Major architectural changes occur
- New features/modules are added
- Integration points change
- Critical decisions are made

**Usage**: AI assistants should load this file first when providing assistance on this project.
```

### 7. Validation Gates

**Before finalizing:**
- ✅ File is under 500 lines for quick loading
- ✅ All sections have actual content (remove empty sections)
- ✅ Links to code examples are accurate
- ✅ Metadata from app.json is correct
- ✅ Architecture diagrams are clear
- ✅ Navigation paths are tested

### 8. Placement & Integration

**Where to create:**
- Place `context.md` at project root (next to app.json)
- If multiple projects, create in each project root

**Git configuration:**
```gitignore
# Add to .gitignore if context contains sensitive info:
# context.md
```

**README integration:**
Update README.md to reference context.md:
```markdown
## For AI Assistants
See [context.md](./context.md) for complete project context.
```

## Output Format

Deliver:
1. ✅ Complete `context.md` file at project root
2. ✅ Summary of what was documented
3. ✅ List of any sections that need manual review/input
4. ✅ Recommendation on update frequency

## Key Principles

- **Concise but Complete**: Include everything AI needs, nothing it doesn't
- **Code-Focused**: Link to actual code, not just describe
- **Living Document**: Easy to update as project evolves
- **Quick Load**: Optimized for AI context window efficiency
- **Self-Contained**: Should make sense without external docs

## Success Criteria

A successful `context.md` enables:
- ✅ New AI assistant can understand project in <2 minutes
- ✅ Developers can orient themselves quickly
- ✅ Architectural decisions are clear and justified
- ✅ Navigation to specific functionality is straightforward
- ✅ Integration points are well-documented
