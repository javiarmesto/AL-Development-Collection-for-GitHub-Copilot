# AL Performance Triage Workflow

Your goal is to review the AL code to detect **inefficient queries, FlowFields, and circular dependencies** that may degrade Business Central performance.

## Context

This workflow systematically analyzes AL code under `${input:Path}` (or entire repository if not specified) to identify and prioritize performance issues. The focus is on detection and ranking, not automatic fixing.

## Guardrails

**Deterministic Requirements:**
- Do not modify source code automatically
- Focus on identifying and ranking hotspots
- Provide actionable recommendations only
- Stop if no performance issues found or insufficient data available

## Process

### 1. Code Analysis

#### Load Target Files

Use `codebase` to analyze:
```
codebase: Load all .al files under ${input:Path}
```

If no path specified, analyze entire repository structure focusing on:
- `/src` directory
- Table and TableExtension objects
- Page and PageExtension objects
- Codeunit objects with business logic
- Report objects

#### Detect Problems

Use `problems` to gather:
```
problems: Check for performance-related warnings and errors
```

Look specifically for:
- FlowField warnings (AL0896 - circular dependencies)
- Query performance hints
- Index usage recommendations

### 2. Performance Hotspot Detection

#### Inefficient Queries

**Find patterns:**
```al
// Red flags:
- FindFirst without SetLoadFields
- FindSet without filtering
- Repeat loops with nested database calls
- Missing key usage
- Unfiltered table scans
```

**Detection criteria:**
- Database calls inside loops
- Missing SetRange before Find operations
- Lack of SetLoadFields for partial records
- Multiple CalcFields in loops

#### FlowField Issues

**Check for:**
- Circular FlowField references (Table A â†’ Table B â†’ Table A)
- Complex CalcFormula expressions
- FlowFields without appropriate indexes
- Excessive FlowField calculations in loops
- Missing SumIndexField opportunities

**Common problem patterns:**
```al
// Circular dependency example:
Table "Customer": FlowField references "Sales Statistics"
Table "Sales Statistics": FlowField references "Customer"

// Solution: Break the circle or use direct calculation
```

#### Loop Optimization Issues

**Identify:**
- Nested loops with database operations
- Repeat-until with unoptimized queries
- Record modifications inside loops
- Commit statements in loops

**Example problems:**
```al
// Bad pattern:
repeat
    OtherTable.SetRange(Field, MainTable.Field);
    if OtherTable.FindSet() then
        repeat
            // Nested database access
        until OtherTable.Next() = 0;
until MainTable.Next() = 0;
```

#### Missing Optimizations

**Look for:**
- Tables without appropriate keys
- Missing SetLoadFields usage
- Inefficient SetRange/SetFilter usage
- Unnecessary field loading
- Redundant database calls

### 3. Impact Assessment

For each finding, evaluate:

**Severity Levels:**
- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Causes significant performance degradation, affects multiple users
- ðŸŸ¡ **High**: Noticeable impact, specific scenarios affected
- ðŸŸ¢ **Medium**: Minor impact, optimization opportunity
- ðŸ”µ **Low**: Best practice suggestion, minimal current impact

**Impact Factors:**
- Frequency of execution
- Data volume processed
- Number of affected users
- Response time impact

### 4. Generate Report

#### Human Gate: Report Content Review
**Performance reports may contain sensitive code patterns**

Before saving report:
1. **Review findings** - Ensure no sensitive information exposed
2. **Validate recommendations** - Confirm suggestions are appropriate
3. **Obtain approval** - Wait for confirmation before creating file

Create `/reports/perf-summary.md` with findings (only after approval):

#### Report Structure
